GWOBHub
==========

GWOBHub is a Github-based site for sharing GWOB applications with the greater GWOB community.

When you create a new GWOB app and upload it to Github, notifying GWOBHub of your app is as simple as making `http://gwob.heroku.com` a post-receive hook for the repository. When you commit to the project, Github will POST information about your repository to GWOBHub. Thanks to Github, GWOBHub will always be up to date.

Generating fake development data
----------

To generate fake data for development purposes, run...

    rake db:seed

This will create a bunch of sample components (with silly, randomly-generated descriptions).
